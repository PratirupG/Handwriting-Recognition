# Handwriting-Recognition

Handwriting-Recognition also known as offline Handwriting-Recognition the objective of this project is to extract all the words from a handwritten paragraph using Deep learing. The model I used is CNNN-LSTM/GRU with CTC loss function. 

Coming Soon (Word Segmentation and Line Segmentation with final inference model)

The model architecture I have taken from this paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.05717.pdf. 

Dataset Used:<br>
  IAM Dataset(http://www.fki.inf.unibe.ch/databases/iam-handwriting-database)</br>
  CVL Dataset(https://cvl.tuwien.ac.at/research/cvl-databases/an-off-line-database-for-writer-retrieval-writer-identification-and-word-spotting/)
